    Attributes:
        num_freqs (int): The number of sampled frequencies.
        num_rffs (int): The number of random fourier features. Note that
            this will be the same for most kernels. The exception is "sine-
            cosine kernels", e.g. RBF, Matern, which use both the sine
            and cosine of each feature to generate two separate random
            features. In this case the user-requested num_rffs must
            be an even number and num_rffs will be set equal to this
            value, while num_freqs will be 0.5 * num_features.
        xdim (tuple): The dimensionality of the input. Only elements
            1 and onwards are used -- element 0 is the number of datapoints
            and is not used by the kernel, so any value for element 0
            is acceptable.
        device (str): Must be one of 'cpu', 'gpu'. Determines where
            calculations are performed.
        hyperparams (np.ndarray): An array of shape (N) for N hyperparameters.
            Initialized here to None, each child class will set to its
            own defaults.
        bounds (np.ndarray): An array of shape (N, 2) for N hyperparameters
            that determines the optimization bounds for hyperparameter tuning.
            Each kernel has its own defaults. The parent class initializes to
            None, child classes must set this value.
        zero_arr: A reference to either np.zeros or cp.zeros, depending on
            self.device. This is for convenience and ensures that child
            classes can call self.zero_arr and get an array appropriate
            for the current device.
        dtype: A reference to either np.float64, np.float32, cp.float32, cp.float64
            depending on self.device and precision (by default, float32 -- we have not
            found using float64 for FHT to provide any significant improvement on
            benchmark problems).
        out_type: A reference to either np.float64 or cp.float64 depending on
            device.
        empty: A reference to either np.emtpy or cp.empty depending on self.device.
        double_precision (bool): If True, generate random features in double precision.
            Otherwise, generate as single precision.

                class as num_rffs.
