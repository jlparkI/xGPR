Coming soon
===============================

Planned / upcoming modifications to xGPR:

  * We are working on further optimization to speed up all
    operations across the board.

  * We plan to add support for distributed computing (to enable
    faster tuning & fitting on large datasets with multiple GPUs).
    The fitting algorithm in xGPR can be parallelized in a
    straightforward way.

  * We plan to continue improving hyperparameter tuning methods
    for approximate GPs.

  * We would like to add Windows support in the near future.
